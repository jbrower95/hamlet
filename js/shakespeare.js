My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\n report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me\nrustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at\nhome unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my\nbirth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are\nbred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,\n they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly\nhir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for\nthe which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him\nas I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the\nsomething that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from\n me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\nbrother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my\neducation. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of\nmy father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against\nthis servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no\n wise remedy how to avoid it.",

Then senseless Ilium,\n  Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\n  Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,\n  Which was declining on the milky head\n  Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.\n  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\n  And, like a neutral to his will and matter,\n   Did nothing.\n  But, as we often see, against some storm,\n  A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\n  The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\n  As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder\n   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\n  Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;\n  And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\n  On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\n  With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\n   Now falls on Priam.\n  Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, \n  In general synod take away her power;\n  Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\n  And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\n   As low as to the fiends!",

'Forgive me my foul murther'?\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess'd\n Of those effects for which I did the murther-\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\nMay one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\nOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice,\n And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\nBuys out the law; but 'tis not so above.\nThere is no shuffling; there the action lies\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\n To give in evidence. What then? What rests?\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\nYet what can it when one cannot repent?\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\n Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay. \nBow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,\nBe soft as sinews of the new-born babe!\nAll may be well.              He kneels.",
